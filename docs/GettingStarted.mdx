# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

A verified API-key is needed to make queries. As of this moment, you will need to contact us at <christian.brevik@volue.com> to get one.

Disclaimer: The API-key is needed for every request and as such it must be kept secret on the server in your environment.

After acquiring a key, requests can be made to: https://sandbox-spark-smartcharging.azurewebsites.net/api.

## Making your first API call

To test out the API, try making a call to `/spot-prices/{priceArea}`. You will need to include the Norwegian price area you want the current spot prices for in the requests. The response of this query will be a list of the current price for each individual hour in the day.

### Curl

<!-- TODO: Update this to use the new API-key header -->

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://sandbox-spark-smartcharging.azurewebsites.net/api/spot-prices/NO1' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "priceArea": "NO1",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "energyUnit": "kWh",
  "pricesIncludingVAT": false,
  "vatRate": null,
  "prices": {
    "2023-03-07T23:00:00+01:00": 0.11098,
    "2023-03-08T00:00:00+01:00": 0.10885,
    "2023-03-08T01:00:00+01:00": 0.10877,
    ...,
    "2023-03-09T22:00:00+01:00": 0.10894
