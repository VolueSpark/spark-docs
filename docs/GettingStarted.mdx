# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Valid client credentials are required to make calls to our API. As of this moment, you will need to contact us to get onboarded as a partner. See [our Authentication guide](./documentation/Authentication) for more details about authentication and how to get onboarded.

After acquiring valid client credentials, requests can be made to our API. See our [Swagger UI](https://api.voluespark.com/smart/v1/swagger) for details about endpoints.

## Making your first API call

The Smart Charging API is located under https://api.voluespark.com/smart/v1, this should be used as the base URL for all calls to the API.

To test out the API, try making a call to `/prices/actual/{priceArea}`. You will need to include the Norwegian price area you want the current spot prices for in the requests. The response of this query will be a list of the current price for each individual hour in the day.

### Request

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  'https://api.voluespark.com/smart/v1/prices/actual/NO1'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "priceArea": "NO1",
  "priceUnits": {
    "currency": "EUR",
    "vat": {
      "rate": 1,
      "hasVAT": false
    },
