# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Valid client credentials are required to make calls to our API. As of this moment, you will need to [contact us](mailto:christian.brevik@volue.com) to get onboarded as a partner. See [our Authentication guide](./documentation/Authentication) for more details about authentication.

After acquiring valid client credentials, requests can be made to our API. See our [Swagger UI](https://api.sandbox.voluespark.com/swagger) for details about endpoints.

## Making your first API call

To test out the API, try making a call to `/api/spot-prices/{priceArea}`. You will need to include the Norwegian price area you want the current spot prices for in the requests. The response of this query will be a list of the current price for each individual hour in the day.

### Request

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  'https://api.sandbox.voluespark.com/api/spot-prices/NO1'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "priceArea": "NO1",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "energyUnit": "kWh",
  "pricesIncludingVAT": false,
  "vatRate": null,
  "prices": {
    "2023-03-07T23:00:00+01:00": 0.11098,
    "2023-03-08T00:00:00+01:00": 0.10885,
    "2023-03-08T01:00:00+01:00": 0.10877,
    ...,
    "2023-03-09T22:00:00+01:00": 0.10894
  }
}
