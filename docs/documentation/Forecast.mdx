# Forecast

The current iteration of the API allows you to make requests to `/api/forecast/{priceArea}` to retrieve a forecast of electricity prices in each area. The forecast contains entries for the next seven days. The endpoint requires two query parameters:

-   ChargingPower `double`: the expected power in kWh at which the vehicle will charge.
-   ChargingLength `integer`: the expected time in hours the vehicle will charge.
