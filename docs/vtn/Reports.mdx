# Events

The base url of the VTN API is https://api.voluespark.com/vtn/v1.

## Request body

```json
{
    "eventId": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "payloads": [
        {
            "payloadType": "VehicleChargeAction",
            "resourceId": "string",
            "location": {
                "latitude": 0,
                "longitude": 0

            "actionType": "Start",
            "current": 0,
            "power": 0,
            "stateOfCharge": 0,
            "batteryCapacity": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

## EventID

Reports responding to a specific event should have the same eventId as the event.

## Payloads

Multiple payloads can be submitted in response to an event. The fields of the payload are determined by the payloadType. At the moment we only support one payloadType: `VehicleChargeAction`.

### VehicleChargeAction

When responding to multiple VehicleChargeActions, an individual payload should be submitted for each vehicle.

-   resourceId (Required)
-   location (Required)
-   actionType (Required): one of the following values: `Start`, `Stop`
-   current (Optional): The current in Ampere
-   power (Optional): The power in Watt
-   stateOfCharge (Optional): The state of charge in percent
-   batteryCapacity (Optional): The battery capacity in kWh
