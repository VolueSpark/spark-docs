# Introduction

This API is inspired by the OpenADR 3.0 draft and much of the terminology mirrors that of the OpenADR 3.0 specification. However, this API is not OpenADR 3.0 compliant.
After careful consideration we have concluded that the full specification of the OpenADR is too complex for our use case. We have therefore decided to implement a subset of the OpenADR specification.
We still use the same terminology and have an open mind to implement more of the OpenADR specification in the future based on the needs of our partners.
Some of the terminology we use, which might be unfamiliar to certain of our partners, is explained in the glossary below.

## Glossary

### Virtual Top Node

We have implemented a Virtual top node (VTN) server. In essence that is what this API is.
A VTN is a server that is responsible for managing the energy resources of a VEN.
The VTN is responsible for sending signals to the VEN to control the energy resources of the VEN.
The VTN is also responsible for receiving reports from the VEN about the energy resources of the VEN.

### Virtual End Node

You as a partner is responsible for implementation of the VEN client.
The VEN is responsible for receiving signals from the VTN and sending reports to the VTN.
The VEN is also responsible for managing the energy resources and responding on events from the VTN.

### Events

Our server will send out events. An event is a request for the VEN to act on various energy resources.
It is up to the VEN to decide how to act on the event. The VEN can choose to ignore the event or act on it.

### Reports

The VEN should respond to events by sending reports to the VTN.
The reports should contain information about the energy resources of the VEN and the actions taken in response to the event.

### Resources

A resource is any energy resource that the VEN can control (e.g. electric vehicles, hot water heaters, solar panels, thermostats, etc).
