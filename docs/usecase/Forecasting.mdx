# Weekly overview - forecast

> #### When there's no urgent need for charging your EV

With the advanced analytics of electricity prices, you can offer EV owners a valuable tool
to help them save money on their power bills. The API provides a prognosis with average prices
for the next seven days, divided into timeslots of 6 hours. This allows users to compare prices
for each timeslot against today's average prices, providing insights into when it is best to charge their vehicles.

By utilizing the forecasting API, EV owners can make informed decisions on the best day or timeslot to charge
their vehicles, maximizing their savings. With the advanced analytics, the API is capable of providing
accurate predictions of electricity prices, helping users to take advantage of lower prices during off-peak periods.

                    Forecasting the average electricity prices can give
                    significant value to the end user, as it allows them to plan
                    their charging sessions more effectively. By predicting when
                    prices are likely to rise or fall, users can adjust their
                    energy usage accordingly, taking advantage of lower prices
                    during off-peak periods and reducing usage during peak
                    times. This not only saves money, but also contributes to a
                    more sustainable energy system, as it reduces the strain on
                    the grid during high-demand periods.

                    Overall, the ability to forecast electricity prices gives
                    users greater control and flexibility over their energy
                    usage, leading to cost savings, sustainability benefits, and
                    better informed decision-making.
