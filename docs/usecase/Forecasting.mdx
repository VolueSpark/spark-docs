# Forecasting

When there's no urgent need for charging

With the advanced analytics of electricity prices, you can offer EV owners a valuable tool
to help them save money on their power bills. The API provides a prognosis with average prices
for the next seven days, divided into timeslots of 6 hours. This allows users to compare prices
for each timeslot against today's average prices, providing insights into when it is best to charge their vehicles.

By utilizing the forecasting API, EV owners can make informed decisions on the best day or timeslot to charge
their vehicles, maximizing their savings. With the advanced analytics, the API is capable of providing
accurate predictions of electricity prices, helping users to take advantage of lower prices during off-peak periods.

## Customer value

Forecasting the average electricity prices can give significant value to the end user, as it allows them to
plan their charging sessions more effectively. By predicting when prices are likely to rise or fall, users
can adjust their energy usage accordingly, taking advantage of lower prices during off-peak periods and
reducing usage during peak times. This not only saves money, but also contributes to a more sustainable
energy system, as it reduces the strain on the grid during high-demand periods.

Overall, the ability to forecast electricity prices gives users greater control and flexibility over their
energy usage, leading to cost savings, sustainability benefits, and better informed decision-making.
