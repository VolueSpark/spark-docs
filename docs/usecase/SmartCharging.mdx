# Why smart charging?
EVs have a central role towards the goal of having a climate neutral Europe by 2050. 
Only in the recent years the number of EVs on the roads has exploded, and there are more to come. 
This means that there will be a new energy demand that needs to be handled, by working together across 
different sectors to improve power grid management. All of these new EVs on the roads are an untapped 
resource in this global issue, and we at Spark are working on creating solutions where EVs are an 
important part of this.

But how do we actually do this? By looking at the way EVs are charged, and give users information and 
incentives for charging when it’s best both for the wallet and the grid. To pull this off, we need to 
create new techincal and behavioral relationships between both the business and the users. We see that 
we need to lower the barriers for grid operators to cooperate with users, and vica-versa.

Spark handles the grid operator side of this, by providing the data, visual examples and business model, 
and partners provides their users with the data and interface in a way that leverage value to them. 
This is an opportunity for partners to create monetary, environmental and social value for their users, 
and for Spark for enable grid operators to leverage this value in balancing the energy system. But what’s 
in it for EV owners?

To make charging more intuitive, frictionless and efficient, we intelligently leverage data and insights to 
optimise your users’ charging sessions based on their needs. By providing users with insight into power price 
predictions for the next few days, Spark's advanced analytics can help EV owners choose the right day or 
timeslot to charge their vehicles during the week, offering additional opportunities for savings on their power bills.

## The Spark approach
In order to effectively tackle the problem at hand and develop long-term, sustainable solutions for the market, 
it has been critical for us to cultivate a conscious approach that balances both data-driven insights and a 
user-centered perspective.
To this end, we have undertaken research on several key areas that are essential to our mission:

- Technical data from EVs to better understand their technical specs, such as WLTP, battery capasity and battery size
- User needs and behavior to gain a better understanding of the expectations and preferences of our target audience, 
which in turn has enabled us to develop more effective solutions that are tailored to their specific needs
- We have been speaking with potential partners to better understand the business and their own products and end-users. 
This data helps us understand how our solutions can integrate with other products, and gain insights into what kind of data the market needs
- Historical and forecasted price data to provide our customers with the most accurate and up-to-date information

By carefully analyzing and synthesizing this data, we have been able to provide our partners with the most relevant and impactful insights, 
data and visual examples - which in turn will help the end-users make informed decisions about when to charge their EVs, allowing them to save 
money and reduce their environmental impact.
