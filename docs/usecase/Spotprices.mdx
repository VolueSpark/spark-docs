# Spotprices

When there’s a need for charging within the same day, or the day after

The API provides EV owners with real-time information on the optimal times to charge their vehicles 
based on spot prices from Nord Pool from the chosen price area. The data set includes information on 
the best charging windows and prices for the present and as long as the spot prices are known. In addition, 
we also provide information on hours to avoid charging to ensure that EV owners are not charged exorbitant rates.

## Customer value
One key benefit of accessing spot prices is that the users can see when it’s best to charge in the near future at a glance.
 Spot prices can fluctuate throughout the day and night, with prices typically being lower during off-peak periods when 
 there is less demand for electricity. By having access to real-time spot prices, users can quickly identify the most 
 cost-effective times to charge and take advantage of lower prices.

Spot prices will also allow for more efficient charging. By charging off-peak periods, users can take advantage of the excess 
capacity in the grid, resulting in a more stable and reliable supply of electricity. This can also help to reduce the strain 
on the grid during high-demand periods, leading to a more sustainable energy system.
