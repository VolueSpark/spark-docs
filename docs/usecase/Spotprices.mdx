# Near future - actual prices

> #### When there's a need for charging within the same day, or the day after

The Spot Prices API provides electric vehicle (EV) owners with real-time information on optimal times to charge their vehicles. This information is based on spot prices from Nord Pool for the chosen price area. In addition to using spot prices, we also look ahead in a price forecast for the next week to analyze the actual prices. This allows us to give optimal advice for the near future.

The dataset includes information on the best charging windows and prices for the present. Additionally, it provides information on hours to avoid charging to ensure that EV owners are not charged exorbitant rates.

## Customer value

Spot prices can fluctuate throughout the day and night, with prices usually being lower during off-peak periods when there is less demand for electricity. When combining actual spot prices with forecasted price data, we can give users the ability to identify the most cost-effective times to charge and take advantage of lower prices in the near future.

In addition, by charging during off-peak periods, users can take advantage of the excess capacity in the grid, resulting in a more stable and reliable supply of electricity. This can also help to reduce the strain on the grid during high-demand periods, leading to a more sustainable energy system.

## Connection to EV data

We are working towards delivering individualized optimized charge plans that build upon data provided by EVs. By leveraging EV data, we can create tailored charge plans that consider factors such as battery health, state of charge, driving habits, and personal preferences.
